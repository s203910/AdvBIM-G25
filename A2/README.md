# Does the structural model have material properties available in IfcModel?
# - According to the report the beams are made from Deltasteel composite profiles. We will test the claim of whether material properties are applied and are readable from the IFC.

# A2c
# A script will gather the info from the IfcModel and verify whether or not material properties are given.
# IfcProperties for IfcBeams need to be gathered.
# This script is relevant in the design phase.
# The BIM purpose is Gather.
# The structural analysis use case is closest to how our use case operates.
# See "file name"

# A2d
# Our script / test is applied in the BPMN step shown in "file name"

# A2e
# The tool will gather an amount of material properties for selected structural elements (in this case IfcBeams), and determine whether or not sufficient information is given, in order to be able to make a structural analysis from the information given in the IfcModel
# The business and societal value of our tool is quality insurance and control tool saving time.

# A2f
# IfcProperties for IfcBeams need to be gathered. It does not seem like all the information in the claim is given in the IfcModel.

# A2g
# The software used is VSC, Python and IfcOpenshell as they are all open source.
